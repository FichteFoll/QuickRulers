Thanks for installing QuickRulers.

This package does not define any key bindings,
so you need to bind the `quick_rulers` command yourself.

Alternatively you can use the command palette with "QuickRulers:".

Here are two example bindings:

    [
      { "keys": ["alt+r"], "command": "quick_rulers" },
      { "keys": ["alt+shift+r"], "command": "quick_rulers",
        "args": {"show_current": false} }
    ]
